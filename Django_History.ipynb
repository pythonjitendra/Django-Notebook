        "**History. Django** was created in the fall of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, **Adrian Holovaty** and **Simon Willison**, began using Python to build applications. It was released publicly under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist **Django** Reinhardt.\n",

        "**Where does the name Django come from?**\n",
        "**Django** is a **Romany** term meaning \"I awake\". It is best known as the nickname of Belgian jazz guitarist Jean Baptiste \"Django\" Reinhardt, whose fame has led to its use throughout music. Django is also the name of a web development framework.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Secure**: When you are doing it in Django, it is ensured that developers don’t commit any mistakes related to security. Some of the common mistakes include SQL injection, cross-site request forgery, clickjacking and cross-site scripting. To manage effectively usernames and passwords, the user authentication system is the key.\n",
